## Biography

Samuel is in his fourth year of undergraduate studies in forest conservation science and mathematics at the University of Toronto. In the James Lab, he assisted in a project involving structural equations and google earth engine to model boreal disturbances. Currently, he's working on a senior thesis using spatial landscape simulation modeling to explore the effects of added conservation layers. His research goal is to use abstract math to build unique models and better understand forest disturbances and tree physiology. Outside of his studies, Samuel also enjoys cooking and live music.
