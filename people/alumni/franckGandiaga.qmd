## Biography

Franck has a BSc from Université de Nantes and MSc from Université de Poitiers, France, and soon a PhD from the Université de Moncton, Canada. He is interested in entomology, forest ecology, the impact of intensive management on communities, landscape genetics, and insect outbreaks. As part of the James Lab, Franck is working on developing models of spruce budworm dispersal using phenology and citizen science data from northern Québec and the Maritimes. If he is not glued to his screen, he can usually be found outside either running or enjoying a nice stroll.
