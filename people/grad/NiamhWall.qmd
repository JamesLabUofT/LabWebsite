## Biography

I am an ecologist interested in the influences determining the extinction or persistence of threatened species with a focus on the influence of habitat loss on the genetics of long-lived species. My PhD research focuses on the landscape and genetic connectivity of turtle populations in southern Ontario, Canada. I am particularly attracted to the challenge of linking ecological research to on-the-ground conservation. 

## Education

-   **University of Toronto**<br /> Masters of Forest Conservation
