## Biography

I am a landscape ecologist and landscape genetics enthusiast. I am currently a PhD student in the James lab and Fortin lab at the University of Toronto. My PhD research focuses on the landscape and genetic connectivity of turtle populations in southern Ontario, Canada. I spend a lot of time thinking about how ecological research can be linked to on-the-ground conservation. 

## Education

-   **University of Toronto**<br /> Masters of Forest Conservation
-   **University of Guelph**<br /> Bachelors of Environmental Management
