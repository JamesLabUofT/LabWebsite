**Postdoctoral Position in Wildfire Science and LiDAR**

We are currently looking for a collaborative, enthusiastic, and creative post-doctoral researcher to contribute to cutting-edge projects in fuels assessment using lidar to improve fire risk modelling and mitigation. 

At the JamesLab, you will be at the forefront of forest disturbance ecology and wildfire science, working on research that informs risk mitigation strategies and advances ecosystem management. With access to advanced computational resources and collaborations spanning academia, government, industry, and first nations, this role provides a broad range of opportunities to develop novel solutions to global challenges. Based in Toronto, a vibrant and multicultural city, you will join a collaborative and well-supported research team committed to scientific excellence.

The position will be part of a large inter-disciplinary project focused on reducing fire risk through better fuels characterization. The successful candidate will have the opportunity to interact with university researchers, provincial and federal government scientists, as well as other students and post-docs from across Canada who are also examining questions related to disturbance ecology, fire behaviour, lidar, remote sensing, and fire / forest management. **We are specifically looking for a highly technical and conceptually competent researcher to take a leadership role in this large multi-faceted project.**

**Qualifications**

- Completed PhD in Forestry, Wildfire Science, Remote Sensing, Computer Science, or related field

- Strong expertise in statistics, high-performance computing, GIS, and remote sensing

- High level programming proficiency (e.g., Python, R) 

- Demonstrated experience with LiDAR (TLS, ALS) data collection and processing (e.g., lidR, Computree, CloudCompare)

- Excellent oral and written English communication skills

- Familiarity with wildfire behaviour models, simulation modelling, fuel mapping, and/or fire risk assessment 

- Previous post-doctoral experience will be considered an asset

Funding will be competitive and commensurate with qualifications (salary range: $65K-$80K)__\*__. Up to three years of funding is available for this position. Support will also be provided for field work, professional development, and conference travel. The anticipated start date is May 2025.
