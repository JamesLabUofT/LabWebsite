It all began with my Ph.D. studies at the University of Tehran in 2012, under the guidance of esteemed mentors Dan Simberloff, Reza Marvi-e-Mohadjer, and Lutz Eckstein. There, I delved deep into the intricacies of Oriental beech forest ecosystems, laying the foundation for my career in academia. Throughout my career spanning from 2006 to 2018, I have had the privilege of working in diverse forest ecosystems across the globe, including Mangrove, Sub-tropical, Arid, Mediterranean, and Temperate forests. However, it was in 2018, during my first visit to Boreal forests, that I experienced an undeniable connection with these remarkable ecosystems. Since then, my focus has shifted towards understanding historical ecology, dendrochronology, and fire ecology in the Canadian Boreal Forest."
